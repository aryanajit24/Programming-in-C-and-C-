Modifications We Made:
Commenting out using namespace std; in Critter.cpp and testcritter.cpp.
Removing the Critter:: prefix from a method in Critter.cpp.
Errors Encountered:
Errors related to undefined identifiers after removing using namespace std;.
Errors indicating that a method is not defined in the class scope after removing the Critter:: prefix.
Interpretation:
Explain why these errors occurred based on C++ syntax and namespace usage.
Solutions:
Prefixing standard library entities with std::.
Re-adding the Critter:: prefix to the method in the Critter.cpp file.
Remember, the goal of these exercises is to help you understand C++ syntax and how error messages can guide code correction. It's important to engage with the process actively and make these modifications yourself to learn effectively.
